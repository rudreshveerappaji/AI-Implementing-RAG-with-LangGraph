# Implementing RAG withLangGraph

### Implementing RAG with LangGraph with simple, ready to use examples, for educational purposes.

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates how to implement a **production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **LangGraph**.

The examples illustrated in this repository are simple yet powerful and can be used as a strong foundation for building enterprise-grade RAG applications.

This repository is structured with clean architecture, modular components, and production-ready patterns that make it easy to extend and deploy.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- Graph-based AI workflows using LangGraph
- Stateful multi-step pipelines
- Document retrieval using Chroma vector database
- LLM-powered relevance grading
- Conditional routing in LangGraph
- Modular and maintainable architecture
- Environment-based configuration management

---

## 🧠 Why LangGraph for RAG?

Traditional RAG pipelines can quickly become messy when adding:

- Retrieval steps
- Validation steps
- Query rewriting
- Conditional fallbacks
- Verification stages

LangGraph solves this by allowing you to:

- Explicitly manage application state
- Visually structure your workflow
- Add conditional branching
- Debug each node independently
- Build scalable, maintainable AI systems

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The system follows a structured graph-based workflow:

### Flow:

1. **Retrieve Documents**
2. **Grade Relevance**
3. **Conditional Routing**
   - If relevant → Generate Answer
   - If not relevant → Fallback Response
4. **Return Final Output**

This architecture allows flexible extension such as:

- Adding query rewriting
- Multi-retriever strategies
- Verification nodes
- Self-correction loops
- Tool integrations

## ⚙ Installation Guide

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/implementing-rag-with-langgraph.git
cd implementing-rag-with-langgraph
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

**Mac / Linux**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

You can copy from `.env.example`.

---

## ▶ Running the Application

```bash
python -m app.main
```

You will see a CLI prompt:

```
Ask a question (or type 'exit'):
```

Ask questions based on the sample document.

---

## 📄 Example

If your `sample_docs.txt` contains:

```
LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-step AI applications.
```

You can ask:

```
What is LangGraph?
```

The system will:

- Retrieve relevant context
- Grade relevance
- Generate grounded answer
- Return response

---

## 🧩 Core Components Explained

### config.py
Centralized configuration management (API keys, model settings, DB settings).

### state.py
Defines shared application state using TypedDict for type safety.

### retriever.py
Handles:
- Embedding creation
- Vector store persistence
- Similarity search

### grader.py
Uses LLM to evaluate whether retrieved documents are relevant.

### generator.py
Generates grounded answers using retrieved context.

### graph.py
Defines the LangGraph workflow:
- Nodes
- Edges
- Conditional routing
- Entry point

### main.py
CLI entry point for interacting with the RAG system.
